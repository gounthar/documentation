## Orange Pi Community Docs
Welcome. This site is a collective effort to document the Orange Pi series of boards, their features, and how best to configure then.

If you are new to Orange Pi boards (and/or single-board computers in general), the Getting Started Section provides essential information on how to set up and use your Orange Pi Board.

Information specific to your Orange Pi Board can be found in the  sections respective to that board.
